   Khabib to Conor: "It is the same thing"
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite the fact almost three years has passed since the pair clashed at UFC 229 - which remains the UFC’s highest-ever selling pay-per-view - the bad blood doesn’t seem to have settled one little bit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whilst the Irishman was a featherweight, Khabib had a healthy respect for him and the pair exchanged admiration over Twitter before meeting up and having a picture together.
  </p>
  <p>
    That’s the man McGregor would target once he became UFC featherweight champion in December 2015 in his bid to become the UFC’s first-ever double champion.RDA would pull out of their matchup just weeks before and Nate Diaz would step in. We all know how that would dominate 2016.
  </p>
  <p>
    At UFC 254, after his victory over Justin Gaethje, the 32-year-old took the entire MMA community by surprise when he announced his decision to retire from the sport with a 29-0 record (13-0 in UFC). Khabib said he did not want to continue without his late father, and that he made a promise to his mother that his fight against Justin would be last.
